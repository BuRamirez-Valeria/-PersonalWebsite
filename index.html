Walking or playing with pets on a regular basis can help lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Companionship from pets can help us cope with loneliness and sadness.

Dogs, cats, and birds are the animals with the most individual personalities. The best part is that your pet's personalities can divert you from your problems, inspire you to laugh more heartily, and keep boredom at bay.</p>

    <h3 class="duck">Benefits of Having Ducks as Pets</h3>
   
    
    <p > What are some of the advantages of keeping ducks as pets? They're flamboyant feathery balls of energy! Each one is unique, and getting to know them as people is a lot of fun.</p>
    
  
    <p > They lay eggs as well, although they are more consistent than chickens. They are relatively long-lived pets, with the potential to live for 10-15 years if properly cared for.</p>



    <p > Keep in mind that they produce a significant amount of manure. As a result, if you have a garden, they make excellent pets. They're also less destructive to your lawn and landscaping than hens. They also eat a lot of insects in the process! </p>

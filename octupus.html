    <h1>🐙 Octupus🐙 </h1>
    <p>Octopuses are not a good choice for a pet in general. For starters, they are quite clever and appear to be easily bored. Octopuses in small aquariums containing flowerpots, stones, beads, and shells nonetheless showed signs of sadness and even self-mutilation, according to one research [pdf]. Octopuses in a more stimulating environment proved to be healthier and happier, with larger tanks, crushed coral, plants, and a view of a live fish in an adjacent tank. So, for an octopus, your typical fish tank layout isn't going to cut it.</p>
